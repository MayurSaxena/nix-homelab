# Recipes for the operations this repo needs most often. `just` with no argument lists them.
#
# Deliberately thin: every recipe is a command you could type by hand, gathered here so the
# flags you have to remember (--build-host, --refresh, the Proxmox auth dance) live in one
# reviewable place instead of your shell history. See CLAUDE.md for what each one is doing
# and why.
